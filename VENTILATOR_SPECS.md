### GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:

The most important and basic characteristics of a medical ventilator for a situation of crisis are present in this document.

However I think there are additional aspects that are important :

  * The driving force of the ventilator should be electric but also pneumatic as, in crisis, it could function with no electricity.
  * The ventilator should also be able to suction air from the room atmosphere with an inspired fraction of oxigen of 21%.
  * It what concerns the mandatory modes I think there should be 2 possibilities:

###    Volume Control:
  * The ventilator switches from the inspiratory phase to the expiratory phase when the ventilator  
    reaches the tidal volume we chose (generaly from 5 to 7 ml/kg)

   We also know that

`  Minute_Volume = Tidal_Volume x Respiratory_Rate`

  In this situation we do need  to have pressure alarms (high and low) because the ventilator 
  will put in the patient the volume we chose at any pressure.
  There is low risk of atelactasisi (lung colapse) but high risk of barotrauma

   It is also desirable that there is the possibility that we have volume control with pressure limitation ( the ventilator never reaches a peak pressure above 35-40 mmHg).

### Pressure control:
  * The ventilator switches from the inspiratory phase to the expiratory phase when it reaches a pressure we chose( normal from 15 to 30 mmHg)

  In this mode we need volume alarms

  There is low risk of barotrauma but high risk of atelectasis 
  (Lung collapse for example, if there is a kinking of the tube)

  * In the assisted modes we should have Assisted pressure, CPAP and BIPAP
  * I also think that there should be the possibility of a range of the  
  inspiratory fraction of oxygen from 21% to 100%
  * An another alarm that is very important is the alarm of low Oxygen and of disconnection.
  * The exhibition of curves of the relationship between pressure and volume that reflects lung
  compliance is **very important**

## Aspetos base de um ventilador para ventilação em condições de **Urgência/ Emergência**
(in portuguese)
1.  Força motriz
  * Elétrica mas com fonte alternativa caso avarie
  * Possibilidade de ser pneumática por exemplo aspirando ar de atmosfera
2. Modos ventilatórios
  *  Volume controlado ( de 100 a 900 ml)
  *  Pressão controlada ( de 10 a 45 cm H<sub>2</sub>O)
  *  PEEP aplicável em qualquer dos modos ( de 0 a 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O)
3. Fração inspirada de oxigénio
  *  De 21% (0,21) a 100% (1) para que o ventilador deverá ser ligado a 2 fontes de gás 
    + Oxigénio
    + Ar comprimido
Alarmes
  *  Alarme de baixa Fração inspirada de oxigénio FUNDAMENTAL ( abaixo de 21%)
  *  Alarme de apneia e desconexão FUNDAMENTAL
  *  Alarme superior de pressão (regulável de 10 a 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>0)
  *  Alarme superior de Volume (regulável de 200 a 900 ml)
4. Visualização de curvas
  *  Pressão nas vias aéreas
  *  Capnografia (End Tidal CO<sub>2</sub>))
  *  Deve haver indicador de espirometria
5. Parâmetros que devemos poder controlar
  *  Pressão de ciclagem
  *  Volume corrente ( ou Tidal) (Atenção: volume minuto é igual a Volume corrente ou
Tidal x Frequência respiratória)
  *  Frequência respiratória
  *  PEEP
  * Fração inspirada de oxigénio
